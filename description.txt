The above is a box plot of the your fleet's daily journies- all journies made in a day count as a single data point. These are compared to the worst case range for a series of electric vehicles, shown as coloured lines.

If most journies are above these coloured lines, it may still be worth switching over to electric vehicles- the chart assumes that all journies made in a day are made in a single leg, not stopping off for any length of time to recharge and assuming the worst case efficiency for the electric vehicles (highway driving at -10c)- 'real range' estimates are typically ~50% better, while best case ranges are typically twice as high.

If very few journies are above the coloured lines, it is strongly recommended to move your fleet over to electric vehicles- Oxford City Centre is due to become Zero Emissions zone, while electric vehicle charging equipment is being fitted throughout the Oxfordshire area and beyond. For the rare journies that are going beyond reasonable ranges for the electric vehicles- or pickup journies where you would not be able to recharge at the destination- hiring an internal combustion engine vehicle for that journey makes more ecological and financial sense.

If no journies are above the line, and many journies are very short distance, it may be sensible to move over to a fleet of electric vehicles shared by multiple users, allowing you to cut down even further on your fleet costs and reduce the traffic further on Oxford's roads.
